# VMware Builder (from VMX)

Type: `vmware-vmx`
Artifact BuilderId: `mitchellh.vmware`
If remote_type is esx: Artifact BuilderId: `mitchellh.vmware-esx`

This VMware Packer builder is able to create VMware virtual machines from an
existing VMware virtual machine (a VMX file). It currently supports building
virtual machines on hosts running [VMware Fusion
Professional](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion-professional/) for OS X,
[VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/overview.html)
for Linux and Windows, and [VMware
Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/player/) on Linux.

The builder builds a virtual machine by cloning the VMX file using the clone
capabilities introduced in VMware Fusion Professional 6, Workstation 10, and
Player 6. After cloning the VM, it provisions software within the new machine,
shuts it down, and compacts the disks. The resulting folder contains a new
VMware virtual machine.

## Basic Example

Here is an example. This example is fully functional as long as the source path
points to a real VMX file with the proper settings:

**JSON**

```json
{
  "type": "vmware-vmx",
  "source_path": "/path/to/a/vm.vmx",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "ssh_password": "root",
  "shutdown_command": "shutdown -P now"
}
```

**HCL2**

```hcl
source "vmware-vmx" "basic-example" {
  source_path = "/path/to/a/vm.vmx"
  ssh_username = "root"
  ssh_password = "root"
  shutdown_command = "shutdown -P now"
}

build {
  sources = ["sources.vmware-vmx.basic-example"]
}
```


## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the VMware builder. They are
organized below into two categories: required and optional. Within each

## Boot Configuration

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/VNCConfig.mdx'

-> **Note**: for the `HTTPIP` to be resolved correctly, your VM's network
configuration has to include a `hostonly` or `nat` type network interface.
If you are using this feature, it is recommended to leave the default network
configuration while you are building the VM, and use the `vmx_data_post` hook
to modify the network configuration after the VM is done building.

### Optional:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/VNCConfig-not-required.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig-not-required.mdx'

For more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our
[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vmware-vmx",
      "boot_key_interval": "10ms",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Example boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an
Ubuntu 12.04 installer:

```text
[
  "<esc><esc><enter><wait>",
  "/install/vmlinuz noapic ",
  "preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg ",
  "debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us ",
  "hostname={{ .Name }} ",
  "fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive ",
  "keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA ",
  "keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false ",
  "initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>"
]
```

[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).

## Building on a Remote vSphere Hypervisor

In addition to using the desktop products of VMware locally to build virtual
machines, Packer can use a remote VMware Hypervisor to build the virtual
machine.

-> **Note:** Packer supports ESXi 5.1 and above.

Before using a remote vSphere Hypervisor, you need to enable GuestIPHack by
running the following command:

```shell-session
$ esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
```

When using a remote VMware Hypervisor, the builder still downloads the ISO and
various files locally, and uploads these to the remote machine. Packer currently
uses SSH to communicate to the ESXi machine rather than the vSphere API.
If you want to use vSphere API, see the [vsphere-iso](/packer/plugins/builders/vsphere/vsphere-iso) builder.

Packer also requires VNC to issue boot commands during a build, which may be
disabled on some remote VMware Hypervisors. Please consult the appropriate
documentation on how to update VMware Hypervisor's firewall to allow these
connections. VNC can be disabled by not setting a `boot_command` and setting
`disable_vnc` to `true`.

Please note that you should disable vMotion for the host you intend to run
Packer builds on; a vMotion event will cause the Packer build to fail.

To use a remote VMware vSphere Hypervisor to build your virtual machine, fill in
the required `remote_*` configurations:

- `remote_type` - This must be set to "esx5".

- `remote_host` - The host of the remote machine.

Additionally, there are some optional configurations that you'll likely have to
modify as well:

- `remote_port` - The SSH port of the remote machine

- `remote_datastore` - The path to the datastore where the VM will be stored
on the ESXi machine.

- `remote_cache_datastore` - The path to the datastore where supporting files
will be stored during the build on the remote machine.

- `remote_cache_directory` - The path where the ISO and/or floppy files will
be stored during the build on the remote machine. The path is relative to
the `remote_cache_datastore` on the remote machine.

- `remote_username` - The SSH username used to access the remote machine.

- `remote_password` - The SSH password for access to the remote machine.

- `remote_private_key_file` - The SSH key for access to the remote machine.

- `format` (string) - Either "ovf", "ova" or "vmx", this specifies the output
format of the exported virtual machine. This defaults to "ovf".
Before using this option, you need to install `ovftool`. This option
currently only works when option remote_type is set to "esx5".
Since ovftool is only capable of password based authentication
`remote_password` must be set when exporting the VM.

- `vnc_disable_password` - This must be set to "true" when using VNC with
ESXi 6.5 or 6.7.

### SSH key pair automation

The VMware builders can inject the current SSH key pair's public key into
the template using the `SSHPublicKey` template engine. This is the SSH public
key as a line in OpenSSH authorized_keys format.

When a private key is provided using `ssh_private_key_file`, the key's
corresponding public key can be accessed using the above engine.

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'

If `ssh_password` and `ssh_private_key_file` are not specified, Packer will
automatically generate en ephemeral key pair. The key pair's public key can
be accessed using the template engine.

For example, the public key can be provided in the boot command as a URL
encoded string by appending `| urlquery` to the variable:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [
  "<up><wait><tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/ks.cfg PACKER_USER={{ user `username` }} PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY={{ .SSHPublicKey | urlquery }}<enter>"
]
```

In HCL2:

```hcl
boot_command = [
  "<up><wait><tab> text ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/ks.cfg PACKER_USER={{ user `username` }} PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY={{ .SSHPublicKey | urlquery }}<enter>"
]
```

A kickstart could then leverage those fields from the kernel command line by
decoding the URL-encoded public key:

```shell
%post

# Newly created users need the file/folder framework for SSH key authentication.
umask 0077
mkdir /etc/skel/.ssh
touch /etc/skel/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Loop over the command line. Set interesting variables.
for x in $(cat /proc/cmdline)
do
  case $x in
    PACKER_USER=*)
      PACKER_USER="${x#*=}"
      ;;
    PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY=*)
      # URL decode $encoded into $PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY
      encoded=$(echo "${x#*=}" | tr '+' ' ')
      printf -v PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY '%b' "${encoded//%/\\x}"
      ;;
  esac
done

# Create/configure packer user, if any.
if [ -n "$PACKER_USER" ]
then
  useradd $PACKER_USER
  echo "%$PACKER_USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/$PACKER_USER
  [ -n "$PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY" ] && echo $PACKER_AUTHORIZED_KEY >> $(eval echo ~"$PACKER_USER")/.ssh/authorized_keys
fi

%end
```
