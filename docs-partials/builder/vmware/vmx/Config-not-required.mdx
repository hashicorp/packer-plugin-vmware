- `linked` (bool) - By default, the plugin creates a 'full' clone of the virtual machine
  specified in `source_path`. The resultant virtual machine is fully
  independent of the parent it was cloned from.
  
  Setting linked to true instead causes the plugin to create the virtual
  machine as a linked clone. Linked clones use and require ongoing
  access to the disks of the parent virtual machine. The benefit of a
  linked clone is that the clones virtual disk is typically very much
  smaller than would be the case for a full clone. Additionally, the
  cloned virtual machine can also be created much faster. Creating a
  linked clone will typically only be of benefit in some advanced build
  scenarios. Most users will wish to create a full clone instead.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `attach_snapshot` (string) - The name of an existing snapshot to which the builder shall attach the
  virtual machine before powering on. If no snapshot is specified the
  virtual machine is started from its current state.  Default to
  `null/empty`.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the `.vmx` file for the virtual machine, without
  the file extension. By default, this is `packer-BUILDNAME`, where
  `BUILDNAME` is the name of the build.

- `snapshot_name` (string) - This is the name of the initial snapshot created after provisioning and
  cleanup. If blank, no snapshot is created.
