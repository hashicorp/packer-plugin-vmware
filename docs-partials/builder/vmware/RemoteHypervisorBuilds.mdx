## Building on VMware vSphere Hypervisor

In addition to using the desktop virtualization products to build virtual
machines, this plugin can use a VMware vSphere Hypervisor to build the virtual
machine.

Before using a vSphere Hypervisor, you need to enable `GuestIPHack` by
running the following command:

```shell-session
$ esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
```

When using the vSphere Hypervisor, the builder still downloads the ISO and
various files locally, and uploads these to the remote hypervisore. This plugin
uses SSH to communicate to the ESXi host rather than the vSphere API. [^2]

This plugin also requires VNC to issue boot commands during a build. Please
refer to the VMware vSphere documentation on how to update the hypervisor's
firewall to allow these connections. VNC can be disabled by not setting a
`boot_command` and setting `disable_vnc` to `true`.

Please note that you should disable vMotion for the host you intend to run
builds on; a vMotion event will cause the build to fail.

To run a remote build for your virtual machine image, use the following
configurations:

**Required**:

- [`remote_type`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`remote_host`](#hypervisor-configuration)

**Optional**:

- [`remote_port`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`remote_datastore`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`remote_cache_datastore`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`remote_cache_directory`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`remote_username`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`remote_password`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`remote_private_key_file`](#hypervisor-configuration)
- [`format`](#export-configuration)
- [`vnc_disable_password`](#advanced-configuration)
