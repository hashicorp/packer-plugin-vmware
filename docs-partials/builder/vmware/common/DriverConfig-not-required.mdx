- `fusion_app_path` (string) - The installation path of the VMware Fusion application. Defaults to
  `/Applications/VMware Fusion.app`
  
  ~> **Note:** This is only required if you are using VMware Fusion as a
  local desktop hypervisor and have installed it in a non-default location.

- `remote_type` (string) - The type of remote hypervisor that will be used. If set, the remote
  hypervisor will be used for the build. If not set, a local desktop
  hypervisor (VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation) will be used.
  Available options include `esx5` for VMware ESXi.

- `remote_datastore` (string) - The datastore where the virtual machine will be stored on the ESXi host.

- `remote_cache_datastore` (string) - The datastore attached to the remote hypervisor to use for the build.
  Supporting files such as ISOs and floppies are cached in this datastore
  during the build. Defaults to `datastore1`.

- `remote_cache_directory` (string) - The directory path on the remote cache datastore to use for the build.
  Supporting files such as ISOs and floppies are cached in this directory,
  relative to the `remote_cache_datastore`, during the build. Defaults to
  `packer_cache`.

- `cleanup_remote_cache` (bool) - Remove items added to the remote cache after the build is complete.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `remote_host` (string) - The fully qualified domain name or IP address of the remote hypervisor
  where the virtual machine is created.
  
  ~> **Note:** Required if `remote_type` is set.

- `remote_port` (int) - The SSH port of the remote hypervisor. Defaults to `22`.

- `remote_username` (string) - The SSH username for access to the remote hypervisor. Defaults to `root`.

- `remote_password` (string) - The SSH password for access to the remote hypervisor.

- `remote_private_key_file` (string) - The SSH key for access to the remote hypervisor.

- `skip_validate_credentials` (bool) - Skip the validation of the credentials for access to the remote
  hypervisor. By default, export is enabled and the plugin will validate
  the credentials ('remote_username' and 'remote_password'), for use by
  VMware OVF Tool, before starting the build. Defaults to `false`.
