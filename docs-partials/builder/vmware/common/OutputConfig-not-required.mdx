- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path on your local machine to the directory where the
  resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or
  absolute. If relative, the path is relative to the working directory
  when Packer is run.
  
  By default, this is `output-BUILDNAME` where `BUILDNAME` is the name of
  the build.
  
  ~> **Note:** This directory must not exist or be empty before running the
  build.
