- `headless` (bool) - The plugin defaults to building virtual machines by launching the
  desktop hypervisor's graphical user interface (GUI) to display the
  console of the virtual machine being built. When this value is set to
  `true`, the virtual machine will start without a console; however, the
  plugin will output VNC connection information in case you need to connect
  to the console to debug the build process. Defaults to `false`.
  
  ~> **Note:** Some users have experienced issues where Packer cannot
  properly connect to a virtual machine when using `headless`. This is
  often attributed to the use of an evaluation license for VMware desktop
  hypervisors. It is recommended to launch the product and accept the
  evaluation license to resolve this if you encounter an issue with this
  option.

- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. Defaults to
  `127.0.0.1`.
  
  ~> **Note:** To bind to all interfaces use `0.0.0.0`.

- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.
  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `5900`.

- `vnc_port_max` (int) - The maximum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.
  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `6000`.
  
  ~> **Note:** The plugin randomly selects port within the inclusive range
  specified by `vnc_port_min` and `vnc_port_max`.

- `vnc_disable_password` (bool) - Disables the auto-generation of a VNC password that is used to secure the
  VNC communication with the virtual machine. Defaults to `false`.
  
  ~> **Important:** Must be set to `true` for remote hypervisor builds with
  VNC enabled.

- `vnc_over_websocket` (bool) - Connect to VNC over a websocket connection. Defaults to `false`.
  
  ~> **Note:** When set to `true`, any other VNC configuration options will
  be ignored.
  
  ~> **Important:** Must be set to `true` for remote hypervisor builds with
  VNC enabled.

- `insecure_connection` (bool) - Do not validate TLS certificate when connecting to VNC over a websocket
  connection. Defaults to `false`.
