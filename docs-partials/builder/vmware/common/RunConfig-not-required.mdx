- `headless` (bool) - The plugin defaults to building virtual machines by launching the
  desktop hypervisor's graphical user interface (GUI) to display the
  console of the virtual machine being built. When this value is set to
  `true`, the virtual machine will start without a console; however, the
  plugin will output VNC connection information in case you need to connect
  to the console to debug the build process. Defaults to `false`.

- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. Defaults to
  `127.0.0.1`.
  
  ~> **Note:** To bind to all interfaces, use `0.0.0.0`.

- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.
  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `5900`.

- `vnc_port_max` (int) - The maximum port number to use for VNC access to the virtual machine.
  The plugin uses VNC to type the `boot_command`. Defaults to `6000`.
  
  ~> **Note:** The plugin randomly selects port within the inclusive range
  specified by `vnc_port_min` and `vnc_port_max`.

- `vnc_disable_password` (bool) - Disables the auto-generation of a VNC password that is used to secure the
  VNC communication with the virtual machine. Defaults to `false`.
