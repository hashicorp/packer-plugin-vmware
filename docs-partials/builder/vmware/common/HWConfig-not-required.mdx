- `firmware` (string) - The firmware type for the virtual machine.
  Allowed values are `bios`, `efi`, and `efi-secure` (for secure boot).
  Defaults to the recommended firmware type for the guest operating system.

- `cpus` (int) - The number of virtual CPUs cores for the virtual machine.

- `cores` (int) - The number of virtual CPU cores per socket for the virtual machine.

- `memory` (int) - The amount of memory for the virtual machine in MB. Defaults to `512`.

- `network` (string) - The network which the virtual machine will connect for desktop
  hypervisors. Use the generic values that map to a device, such as
  `hostonly`, `nat`, or `bridged`. Defaults to `nat`.
  
  ~> **Note:** If not set to one of these generic values, then it is
  assumed to be a network device (_e.g._, `VMnet0..x`).

- `network_name` (string) - The network which the virtual machine will connect on a remote
  hypervisor.

- `network_adapter_type` (string) - The network adapter type for the virtual machine.
  Allowed values are `vmxnet3`, `e1000e`, and `e1000`
  
  Refer to the VMware desktop hypervisor product documentation for
  the network adapter types supported by the guest operating system
  and the CPU architecture (`amd64/x86_64` vs `arm64/aarch64`).

- `sound` (bool) - Enable virtual sound card device. Defaults to `false`.

- `usb` (bool) - Enable USB controller for the virtual machine.
  Defaults to `false`.
  
  ~> **Note:** Automatically enabled on Apple Silicon-based systems to
  ensure plugin functionality.

- `usb_version` (string) - USB version to use when USB is enabled. Defaults to `3.1`.
  Allowed values are `2.0`, `3.1`, and `3.2`.
  
  ~> **Note:** Both `3.2` and `3.1` produce an identical configuration
  for the virtual machine. VMware Fusion and Workstation 25H2 and
  later use `3.2`, whereas previous versions use `3.1`.
  
  ~> **Note:** Automatically set on Apple Silicon-based systems to ensure
  plugin functionality.

- `serial` (string) - Add a serial port to the virtual machine. Use a format of
  `Type:option1,option2,...`. Allowed values for the field `Type` include:
  `FILE`, `DEVICE`, `PIPE`, `AUTO`, or `NONE`.
  
  * `FILE:path(,yield)` - Specifies the path to the local file to be used
    as the serial port.
  
    * `yield` (bool) - This is an optional boolean that specifies
      whether the virtual machine should yield the CPU when polling the
      port. By default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `DEVICE:path(,yield)` - Specifies the path to the local device to be
     Â  used as the serial port. If `path` is empty, then default to the first
     serial port.
  
    * `yield` (bool) - This is an optional boolean that specifies
      whether the virtual machine should yield the CPU when polling the
      port. By default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `PIPE:path,endpoint,host(,yield)` - Specifies to use the named-pipe
     "path" as a serial port. This has a few options that determine how the
     VM should use the named-pipe.
  
    * `endpoint` (string) - Chooses the type of the VM-end, which can be
      either a `client` or `server`.
  
    * `host` (string) - Chooses the type of the host-end, which can be
      either `app` (application) or `vm` (another virtual-machine).
  
    * `yield` (bool) - This is an optional boolean that specifies whether
      the virtual machine should yield the CPU when polling the port. By
      default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `AUTO: (yield)` - Specifies to use auto-detection to determine the
     serial port to use. This has one option to determine how the virtual
     machine should support the serial port.
  
    * `yield` (bool) - This is an optional boolean that specifies whether
      the virtual machine should yield the CPU when polling the port. By
      default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `NONE` - Specifies to not use a serial port. (default)

- `parallel` (string) - Add a parallel port to add to the virtual machine. Use a format of
  `Type:option1,option2,...`. Allowed values for the field `Type` include:
  `FILE`, `DEVICE`, `AUTO`, or `NONE`.
  
  * `FILE:path` - Specifies the path to the local file to be used for the
     parallel port.
  
  * `DEVICE:path` - Specifies the path to the local device to be used for
     the parallel port.
  
  * `AUTO:direction` - Specifies to use auto-detection to determine the
     parallel port. Direction can be `BI` to specify bidirectional
     communication or `UNI` to specify unidirectional communication.
  
  * `NONE` - Specifies to not use a parallel port. (default)
