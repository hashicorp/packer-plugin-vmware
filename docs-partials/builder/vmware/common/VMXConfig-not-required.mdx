- `vmx_data` (map[string]string) - Key-value pairs that will be inserted into the virtual machine `.vmx`
  file **before** the virtual machine is started. This is useful for
  setting advanced properties that are not supported by the plugin.
  
  ~> **Note**: This option is intended for advanced users who understand
  the ramifications of making changes to the `.vmx` file. This option is
  not necessary for most users.

- `vmx_data_post` (map[string]string) - Key-value pairs that will be inserted into the virtual machine `.vmx`
  file **after** the virtual machine is started. This is useful for setting
  advanced properties that are not supported by the plugin.
  
  ~> **Note**: This option is intended for advanced users who understand
  the ramifications of making changes to the `.vmx` file. This option is
  not necessary for most users.

- `vmx_remove_ethernet_interfaces` (bool) - Remove all network adapters from virtual machine `.vmx` file after the
  virtual machine build is complete. Defaults to `false`.
  
  ~> **Note**: This option is useful when building Vagrant boxes since
  Vagrant will create interfaces when provisioning a box.

- `display_name` (string) - The inventory display name for the virtual machine. If set, the value
  provided will override any value set in the `vmx_data` option or in the
  `.vmx` file. This option is useful if you are chaining builds and want to
  ensure that the display name of each step in the chain is unique.
