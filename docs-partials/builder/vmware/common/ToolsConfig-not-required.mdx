- `tools_mode` (string) - The mode for providing VMware Tools to the virtual machine. Must be
  explicitly specified when using any tools configuration. Allowed values are:
  - `upload`: Uploads VMware Tools ISO to the virtual machine during the build.
    Requires either `tools_upload_flavor` or `tools_source_path` to be specified.
  - `attach`: Attaches the VMware Tools ISO to the virtual machine as a CD-ROM
    device during the build and removes the device upon build completion.
    Requires `tools_source_path` to be specified.
  - `disable`: No VMware Tools ISO is provided to the virtual machine.
    Any other tools configuration fields are ignored.

- `tools_source_path` (string) - The absolute local path on your machine to the VMware Tools ISO file.
  Can be used with `tools_mode` set to `attach` or `upload`. When used with
  `upload` mode, cannot be used together with `tools_upload_flavor`.
  
  Must be a path accessible during the build (e.g., "/path/to/vmware-tools.iso".)

- `tools_upload_flavor` (string) - The flavor of VMware Tools to upload into the virtual machine based on the
  guest operating system. Can only be used when `tools_mode` is set to
  `upload`. Cannot be used together with `tools_source_path`. Allowed
  values include: `darwin` (macOS), `linux`, and `windows`.
  
  The plugin will load the VMware Tools ISO from the desktop hypervisor's
  default installation directory based on the specified flavor, if available.

- `tools_upload_path` (string) - The absolute path in the virtual machine guest operating system where the
  VMware Tools ISO will be uploaded. Only used when `tools_mode` is set to
  `upload`. This is a [configuration template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine)
  that has a single valid variable: `Flavor`, which will be the value of
  `tools_upload_flavor`. Defaults to `{{.Flavor}}.iso` when
  `tools_upload_flavor` is specified.
  
  Must be an absolute path in the guest operating system (e.g., "/tmp/vmware-tools.iso").
