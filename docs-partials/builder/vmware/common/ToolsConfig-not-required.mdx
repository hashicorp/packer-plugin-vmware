- `tools_upload_flavor` (string) - The flavor of VMware Tools to upload into the virtual machine based on
  the guest operating system. Allowed values are `darwin` (macOS), `linux`,
  and `windows`. Default is empty and no version will be uploaded.

- `tools_upload_path` (string) - The path in the VM to upload the VMware tools. This only takes effect if
  `tools_upload_flavor` is non-empty. This is a [configuration
  template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) that has a
  single valid variable: `Flavor`, which will be the value of
  `tools_upload_flavor`. By default, the upload path is set to
  `{{.Flavor}}.iso`.
  
  ~> **Note:** This setting is not used when `remote_type` is `esxi`.

- `tools_source_path` (string) - The local path on your machine to the VMware Tools ISO file.
  
  ~> **Note:** If not set, but the `tools_upload_flavor` is set, the plugin
  will load the VMware Tools from the product installation directory.
