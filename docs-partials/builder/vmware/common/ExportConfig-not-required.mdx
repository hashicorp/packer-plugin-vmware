- `format` (string) - The output format of the exported virtual machine. Allowed values are
  `ova`, `ovf`, or `vmx`. Defaults to `vmx`.
  
  ~> **Note:** Ensure VMware OVF Tool is installed. For the latest version,
  visit [VMware OVF Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest).
  
  ~> **Note:** The plugin will create a `.vmx` and supporting files in the
  output directory and will then export the virtual machine to the specified
  format. These files are **not** automatically cleaned up after the export process.

- `ovftool_options` ([]string) - Additional command-line arguments to send to VMware OVF Tool during the
  export process. Each string in the array represents a separate
  command-line argument.
  
  ~> **Important:** The plugin does not preset any VMware OVF Tool options
  by default.
  
  ~> **Note:** Ensure VMware OVF Tool is installed. For the latest version,
  visit [VMware OVF Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest).

- `skip_export` (bool) - Skips the export of the virtual machine. This is useful if the build
  output is not the resultant image, but created inside the virtual
  machine. This is useful for debugging purposes. Defaults to `false`.

- `skip_compaction` (bool) - At the end of the build process, the plugin defragments and compacts the
  disks using `vmware-vdiskmanager`. In some cases, this process may result
  in slightly larger disk sizes. If this occurs, you can opt to skip the
  disk compaction step by using this setting. Defaults to `false`.
