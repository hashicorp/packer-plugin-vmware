- `format` (string) - The output format of the exported virtual machine. Allowed values are
  `ova`, `ovf`, or `vmx`. Defaults to `vmx` for local desktop hypervisors
  and `ova` for remote hypervisors.
  
  For builds on a remote hypervisor, `remote_password` must be set when
  exporting the virtual machine
  
  For builds on a local desktop hypervisor, the plugin will create a `.vmx`
  and export the virtual machine as an `.ovf` or `.ova` file. THe plugin
  will not delete the `.vmx` and `.vmdk` files. You must manually delete
  these files if they are no longer needed.
  
  ~> **Note:** Ensure VMware OVF Tool is installed. For the latest version,
  visit [VMware OVF Tool](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest).
  
  ~> **Note:** For local builds, the plugin will create a `.vmx` and
  supporting files in the output directory and will then export the
  virtual machine to the specified format. These files are **not**
  automatically cleaned up after the export process.

- `ovftool_options` ([]string) - Additional command-line arguments to send to VMware OVF Tool during the
  export process. Each string in the array represents a separate
  command-line argument.
  
  ~> **Important:** The options `--noSSLVerify`, `--skipManifestCheck`, and
  `--targetType` are automatically applied by the plugin for remote exports
  and should not be included in the options. For local OVF/OVA exports,
  the plugin does not preset any VMware OVF Tool options by default.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Skips the export of the virtual machine. This is useful if the build
  output is not the resultant image, but created inside the virtual
  machine. This is useful for debugging purposes. Defaults to `false`.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Determines whether a virtual machine built on a remote hypervisor should
  remain registered after the build process. Setting this to `true` can be
  useful if the virtual machine does not need to be exported. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `skip_compaction` (bool) - At the end of the build process, the plugin defragments and compacts the
  disks using `vmware-vdiskmanager` or `vmkfstools` for ESXi environments.
  In some cases, this process may result in slightly larger disk sizes.
  If this occurs, you can opt to skip the disk compaction step by using
  this setting. Defaults to `false`. Defaults to `true` for ESXi when
  `disk_type_id` is not explicitly defined and `false`
