- `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size(s) of additional virtual hard disks in MB. If not specified,
  the virtual machine will contain only a primary hard disk.

- `disk_adapter_type` (string) - The adapter type for additional virtual disk(s). Available options
   are `ide`, `sata`, `nvme`, or `scsi`.
  
  ~> **Note:** When specifying `scsi` as the adapter type, the default
  adapter type is set to `lsilogic`. If another option is specified, the
  plugin will assume it is a `scsi` interface of that specified type.
  
  ~> **Note:** This option is intended for advanced users.

- `vmdk_name` (string) - The filename for the virtual disk to create _without_ the `.vmdk`
  extension. Defaults to `disk`.

- `disk_type_id` (string) - The type of virtual disk to create. The available options include:
  
    | Type ID | Description                                                             |
    |---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `0`     | Growable virtual disk contained in a single file (monolithic sparse).   |
    | `1`     | Growable virtual disk split into 2GB files (split sparse).              |
    | `2`     | Preallocated virtual disk contained in a single file (monolithic flat). |
    | `3`     | Preallocated virtual disk split into 2GB files (split flat).            |
    | `4`     | Preallocated virtual disk compatible with ESXi (VMFS flat).             |
    | `5`     | Compressed disk optimized for streaming.                                |
  
    Defaults to `1`
  
    ~> **Note:** Set `skip_compaction` to `true` when using `zeroedthick`
    or `eagerzeroedthick` due to default disk compaction behavior.
  
  ~> **Note:** This option is intended for advanced users.
