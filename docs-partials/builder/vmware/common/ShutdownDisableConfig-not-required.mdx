- `shutdown_disabled` (bool) - Disables the default shutdown process. This is useful for debugging.
  Normally, Packer halts a virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If set to `true`, the virtual
  machine will not be halted, but the plugin but will assume that you will
  send the stop signal (_e.g._, a script or the final provisioner).
  
  ~> **Note:** Takes precedence over `shutdown_command`.
  
  ~> **Note:** The default five (5) minute timeout will be observed unless
  the `shutdown_timeout` option is set.
