- `disk_size` (uint) - The size of the disk in megabytes. The builder uses expandable virtual
  hard disks. The file that backs the virtual disk will only grow as needed
  up to this size. Default is 40000 (~40 GB).

- `cdrom_adapter_type` (string) - The type of controller to use for the CD-ROM device.
  Allowed values are `ide`, `sata`, and `scsi`.

- `guest_os_type` (string) - The guest operating system identifier for the virtual machine.
  Defaults to `other-64` on amd64 and `arm-other-64` on arm64.

- `version` (int) - The virtual machine hardware version. Refer to [KB 315655](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=315655)
  for more information on supported virtual hardware versions.
  Minimum is 13. Default is 19.

- `vm_name` (string) - The name of the virtual machine. This represents the name of the virtual
  machine `.vmx` configuration file without the file extension.
  Default is `packer-<BUILDNAME>`, where `<BUILDNAME>` is the name of the
  build.

- `vmx_disk_template_path` (string) - The path to a [configuration template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine)
  for defining the contents of a virtual machine `.vmx` configuration file
  for a virtual disk. Template variables `{{ .DiskType }}`, `{{ .DiskUnit }}`,
  `{{ .DiskName }}`, and `{{ .DiskNumber }}` are available for use within
  the template.
  
  ~> **Note:** This option is intended for advanced users, as incorrect
  configurations can lead to non-functional virtual machines.

- `vmx_template_path` (string) - The path to a [configuration template](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine)
  for defining the contents of a virtual machine `.vmx` configuration file.
  
  ~> **Note:** This option is intended for advanced users, as incorrect
  configurations can lead to non-functional virtual machines. For simpler
  modifications of the virtual machine`.vmx` configuration file, consider
  using `vmx_data` option.

- `snapshot_name` (string) - The name of the virtual machine snapshot to be created.
  If this field is left empty, no snapshot will be created.

- `vhv_enabled` (bool) - Enable virtual hardware-assisted virtualization for the virtual machine.
  Defaults to `false`.
