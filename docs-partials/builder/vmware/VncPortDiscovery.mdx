~> **Note**: Packer dynamically selects a VNC port for remote builds by scanning a range from
`vnc_port_min` to `vnc_port_max`. It looks for an available port by checking if
anything is listening on each port within this range. In environments with
multiple clients building on the same ESXi host, there might be competition for
VNC ports. To manage this, you can adjust the connection timeout with the
`PACKER_ESXI_VNC_PROBE_TIMEOUT` environment variable. This variable sets the
timeout in seconds for each VNC port probe attempt to determine if the port is
available. The default is 15 seconds. Decrease this timeout if VNC connections
are frequently refused, or increase it if Packer struggles to find an open port.
This setting is an advanced configuration option and should be used with caution.
Ensure your firewall settings are appropriately configured before making
adjustments.
